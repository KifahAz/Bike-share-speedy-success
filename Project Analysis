Objective: Discovering the relation between members and casulas usage of bikes. While the company is seeing that members are more profitable and they want to study the
           performance in order to have more memberships from casuals.

Analysis: 1- Calculating the duration of each trip by subtracting the end time from the start time
          2- Extracting the weekday and the month that the biker rented the bike in.
          3- Droping the start station and its id with the end station and its id after discovering that they have more than 15% of null values which make around
             more than 1 million missing values. Also not knowing much about these stations and how they are located and what strategic importance they have made me taking
             this decision to delete them. I think the ride duration will be good for my analysis.
